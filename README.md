# Word Document RCE with a ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo Langchain Agent
This repository demonstrates the use of a Langchain Agent to carry out Remote Code Execution (RCE). Specifically, it involves opening a reverse shell on a target device hosting the Agent.

## Instructions
1. Open the repository in VSCode and use [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to open the repository using the Command Palette command `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.
2. Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Set your `OPEN_API_KEY` environment variable in the `run_agent.py` file at the bottom.
4. Start the agent by running `python run_agent.py`. This hosts the agent with a Gradio frontend accessible at `localhost:8999`.
5. In a separate terminal, execute `python run_shell_connection.py`. This script hosts a socket that polls for a connection to the reverse-shell code found in the attached Word document.
6. Upload the `Document_Processing_Instructions.docx` file through the Gradio frontend's upload field, located under the "Additional Inputs" tabs at the bottom.
7. Submit the following prompt through the Gradio frontend: "Can you execute the instructions in Document_Processing_Instructions.docx?"

After approximately twenty seconds, you should see a connection to the socket initiated from the `run_shell_connection.py` script, indicating that the LLM agent has executed the hidden code at the beginning of the Word document.

To view the code in the Word document, open it in Microsoft Word, select all the text (CMD/CTRL + A), and then click the 'Show/Hide formatting marks' button in the Font section of the Home tab. The code text is hidden by setting the font effects to 'Hidden'.

Please note: The agent does NOT always execute the code; occasionally, ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo may recognize the nature of the code (a reverse shell) and refuse to run it. With the given prompt, the code executes approximately 80% of the time.
